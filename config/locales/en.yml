          We aim to provide objective information to help you make better
          healthcare decisions.Therefore, we cannot offer recommendations or
          analysis.
        asap:
          Inquiries marked ‘ASAP’ will include a comprehensive search of relevant tertiary literature, prescribing information,
          and pearls from the PharmD reviewer-- but without a review of primary literature.
      objectivity:
        "We aim to provide objective information to help you make better
        healthcare decisions; therefore, we cannot offer recommendations or
        analysis. You may still make edits before submitting.

    complete_label: Ready for review?
    editor_placeholder: Copy and paste a table from Microsoft Word into this field.
    editor_tips_label: Hey, what happened to my formatting?
    editor_tips_html:
      "Since these tables will be viewed on many kinds of devices (such as phones,
      tablets, and desktop computers), only very basic formatting is preserved.
      When making your table, keep the following in mind:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Try to have just one value or heading per table cell. Avoid separating multiple
          values or headings with newlines.
        </li>
        <li>
          The first row of each table will automatically be bolded
          for you. Otherwise, italicized and bolded text won't show up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't worry if the column widths seem odd: the table will be resized
          as necessary for each device.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you need to make a change, you can edit the table directly on this
          page, or you can copy and paste the table from this page back into Word.
        </li>
      </ul>"
